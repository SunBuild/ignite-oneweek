<h2>IGNITE Programs</h2>
<strong>Panel Discussions</strong>
<ul>Women in STEM careers visit the girls during a panel discussion to tell their stories of how they pursued their careers and can help the girls see whatâ€™s possible. The girls are inspired by hearing stories they can relate to help them plan their future careers.</ul>
<strong>Field Trips</strong>
<ul>Field trips to corporations are held during the school day to introduce girls to how women use and advance technology daily in their work and show the many different types of STEM careers that one company can have. Field trips to community college and universities also highlight the STEM major programs, talks by professors and professional women.</ul>
<strong>Programming or Interactive Workshops</strong>
<ul>Corporate and College field trips usually include at least one interactive workshop for the girls that can include programming or brainstorming or design activities. Sometimes these classes are also held at the school sponsored by a corporation.</ul>
<strong>Job Shadow</strong>
<ul>Girls visit a business workplace for 3-4 hours and shadow a mentor who shows them how they work, from sitting in on team collaboration meetings to pair- programming and a Q&amp;A session.</ul>
