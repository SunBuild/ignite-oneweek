<span style="margin: 0px; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000;">The U.S. has such low statistics for women in STEM because there are barriers of perception about these career choices. Girls often think to themselves that they aren't smart enough, their grades aren't good enough, their parents have no money to send them to school, or that their home life isn't the â€˜rightâ€™ kind for these jobs. And they have no idea what these career choices are like at all. It's rare for a girl to know a woman in STEM and understand or even know what she does. How can anyone pick a career if they have no idea what it's even about? Telling the story about your STEM path will go a long way in inspiring them.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>How Can You Volunteer?</strong></span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The most common way for volunteers to spend their time with young aspiring girls is through school-organized panels. These panels look for up to 6 professional women currently in STEM careers and invite them to present briefly about their careers by telling their personal story to a group of high school girls.Â </span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The panel discussion introduces girls to the various technology careers women have pursued and how they got to where they are today. Hearing women speak about the various paths they took to their careers helps girls understand what opportunities are available to them and opens their eyes to possibilities.</span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">If you are interested in volunteering in a panel, we invite you to continue reading the panel guidelines to gain a better understanding of the types of questions asked. Afterwards, you may create a profile that links your background and credentials so we can certify you as an official volunteer!</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Preparing as a Volunteer Panelist</strong></span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Panels are a time where girls get to learn about you, why you chose the path you did, how you got where you are today and to relate with them that you were once their age. This is our time to showcase who you are, your story, and how choosing a career in STEM has made a difference in your life.</span>

<span style="margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">For many of these students, the IGNITE events are the first time they have ever heard what women in technology do, or what an engineer is. It is also their first time to truly understand the breadth of career choices in technology beyond the stereotype programmer, such as technical writing, program management, testing and design careers. It is urgent that we take this time to help them learn about these careers, so they may understand what is available in STEM careers, that there is a career for every interest, and from there they can have the choice to find their passion in STEM. </span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Each volunteer will have 3-5 minutes to tell their story and then additional time to answer questions at the end. The following topics are encouraged for discussion:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="color: #000000;">Why did you want to be here today? Telling girls that you care makes the discussion personal and creates a larger impact.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="color: #000000;">What did you like to do as a girl when you were age 13-18?</span></li>
 	<li><span style="color: #000000;">How did you find your interest in technology or engineering?</span></li>
 	<li><span style="color: #000000;">What type of education choices did you make to lead you to your career?</span></li>
 	<li><span style="color: #000000;">Why would you suggest girls take computer science or engineering classes at their school?</span></li>
 	<li><span style="color: #000000;">Do they know what classes are available or why this is a great opportunity to sign up for these classes?</span></li>
 	<li><span style="color: #000000;">What obstacles did you have to overcome to get to where you are today? We encourage you to share a real story that can relate to the girls.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="color: #000000;">What is your career and what do you like about your career now?</span></li>
 	<li><span style="color: #000000;">Why would you encourage girls to consider going into technology or engineering careers?</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">At IGNITE we believe the girls can help the world in many ways by choosing a STEM career. Preparing for this starts now, at the middle school and high school levels. That is why itâ€™s important that we make an impression on them now that will stay with them as they continue to make choices in education and future careers. </span>
