<h3 class="widget-title">The IGNITE Mission</h3>
<div class="textwidget">

Our mission is to inspire girls to become the future technology leaders and innovators of our world.

IGNITE addresses the skills gap and gender gap that exists in our country for women. By reaching girls in grades 6-12, they will have a clear pathway to success in the 21st Century economy.

IGNITE Worldwide provides equal access to career and technical education for underrepresented populations. We discovered that inviting girls to informational programs where they met women working in STEM careers immediately increased girls interest up to 50% in technology programs offered by the school district. IGNITE Worldwide introduces school girls from grades 6-12 to technology careers via panel discussions, job shadowing, technology workshops, mentoring, and field trips throughout the school year to visit the work places of professional women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) careers.

IGNITE Worldwide has educated and empowered over 30,000 young women in middle school and high school grades to pursue education and careers in STEM.

<h3 class="widget-title">Why ‚ÄúIGNITE Worldwide‚Äù?</h3>
<div class="textwidget">
<div>¬†IGNITE has been volunteering at the World Affairs Council for many years. Many teachers and educational leaders visit our country and want to know about girls programs they can replicate in their own communities. IGNITE has offered workshops and the program at no cost for any community in the world who has that need and cannot afford to pay for it. We have established flourishing¬†IGNITE¬†chapters in Nigeria, Uganda and Ghana. After years of offering workshops at the World Affairs Council, IGNITE can be proud of the name- IGNITE Worldwide!</div>
