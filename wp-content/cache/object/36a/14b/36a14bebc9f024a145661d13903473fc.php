A: Age appropriate is important, tailor to middle school or high school. To draw the line, sharing the real story helps connect to girls tremendously. For middle schoolers, it's a focus on accepting that mistakes are OK. For high schoolers, it is more appropriate to talk about struggles and obstacles.

&nbsp;

<strong>Q: How much of a time commitment is this?</strong>

A: Panels are typically 90 minutes long, no longer than 2 hours. When they speak, try to keep it to 5 minutes, you want to leave time for questions.

&nbsp;

<strong>Q: Should volunteers get in touch with the teacher?</strong>

A: IGNITE encourages volunteers to interact with teachers to make sure equipment is ready to use.

&nbsp;

<strong>Q: Women have experienced sexism and real life issues at work. Should I share this in fear of discouraging them?</strong>

A: We want to remind women that this is the beginning of the pipeline, and girls have a lot of barriers to even come to the panel event. It's ok to say that sexism exists in the workplace, but we must remember that this is the beginning of the pipeline and we want to leave with a positive impression. If asked, give an honest response, but tell them how you've dealt with it.
